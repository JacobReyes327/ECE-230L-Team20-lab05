# Lab 05 - Combinatorial Logic

In this lab, you’ve learned real world applications of digital logic, as well
as how to assemble your own Verilog modules. In addition, you’ve learned how
the constraints file maps your inputs and outputs to real pins on the FPGA.

## Lab Summary

## Lab Questions

### 1 - Explain the role of the Top Level file.
The top level file connects the circuit together by assinging inputs and outputs to the gates. It assigns meaning to them by defining the physical inputs and outputs on the board.

### 2 - Explain the function of the Constraints file.


### 3 - Was the selection of Minterm and Maxterm correct for each circuit? What would you have chosen?
For circuit a and circuit b, it wouldn't have mattered if you used maxterms or minterms, since you would get the same result as long as you chose the most optimal result. Minterms would have been more intuitive, but the result is the same.
